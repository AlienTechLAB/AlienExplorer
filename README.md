# AlienExplorer

This is meant to be an open source tool for variety of low-level jobs like: disassembly, debugging, reverse engineering, etc. for GNU/Linux.

You can do whatever you like with this code - just remember that, if you are going use some parts of this code then your project also MUST be open source (GNU General Public License v3.0). Of course, you can learn from my code and write your own from scratch. In such case it's yours code and it doesn't have to be open source. Knowledge is FREE!
